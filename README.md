# Sprout HRIS
An automated HR and Payroll system.

## Technologies

<div><b>Frontend</b>: React (v16.0.0) + Reactstrap (v8.4.1) </div>
<div><b>Backend</b>: .NET (v5) + Entity Framework (v5.0.4) </div>
<div><b>Database</b>: Microsoft SQL Server </div>

## Suggested Improvements (By Priority)

### Version Update
A framework update comes with a lot of good things like the removal of bugs discovered in the previous version(s), patch security flaws, performance improvements, and new features that make the development process easier.

### Separation of Frontend/Backend Directories
Keeping the back-end and front-end separate will lessen your chances of breaking the entire website. It would be easier to debug since you would already know if it's a front-end issue or a back-end one

### Typescript for React
Typescript enables developers to add type safety to their projects. Moreover, TypeScript provides various other features, like interfaces, type aliases, abstract classes, function overloading, tuple, generics, etc
